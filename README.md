# Train

This repository allows to train the bart-fine-tuned-v1 model.

## Datasets

[all_v1 (opensource dataset)](./datasets/train%20datasets/all_v1.json)
[aibus helicopters train set](./datasets/train%20datasets/airbus_helicopters_train_set.json)

[train / test split datasets](./datasets/test%20split%20datasets/)

## Start the project (development)

[Code for model training is inside a jupyter notebook](./train%20note%20books/fine%20tune%20bart.ipynb)

```bash
# go to the train note books directory
cd './train note books'
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
